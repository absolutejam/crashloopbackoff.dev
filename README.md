To see a list of available tasks, run `task --list`.

## Getting started

To launch locally, run `task serve`

To build the static site, run `task build`

## Notes

- Currently [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/) seems to only
  respect anything under `/content/docs/...`
  (See [this issue](https://github.com/withastro/starlight/discussions/966#discussioncomment-7362625))
