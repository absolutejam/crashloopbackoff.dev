This is my place for documenting what I know,
learning what I don't, and sharing what I've discovered.

I'm a DevOps/Platform/Cloud engineer in the North-East of England, and I'm
passionate about everything infrastructure, development and automation. I love
learning and I strive to be continually challenged.

I spend my spare time with my family, longboarding, tinkering with side-projects,
reading fantasy fiction and working out.

## Tech

I try to remain pragmatic and adaptable, so I'm able to learn and use different
tools, languages and paradigms.

I'm an evangelist of Kubernetes and event-driven architecture; my go-to 
languges are Go, Rust and Typescript; and I use neovim (btw).

Part of the being in the DevOps space means wearing a lot of hats, and I get
involved in...

  - Application & infrastructure design and implementation
  - Streamlining the software delivery lifecycle
  - Internal tooling, automation & integrations
  - Observability & following SRE principals
  - Proactive security and cost analysis

## The blog

The blog is built upon the amazing [Astro](https://astro/build) 
framework, [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) and
